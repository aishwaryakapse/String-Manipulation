/*
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) 
 * of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's 
 * h-index. A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at 
 * least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more 
 * than h citations each.

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the 
researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 
3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 
papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no 
more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
